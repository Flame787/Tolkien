      <h2>Short biography:</h2>
      <p>
        Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa and died
        on 2 September 1973, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England. He is best known
        as the author of the high fantasy classic works:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion"
          >The Silmarillion</a
        >, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_RingsThe"
          >The Lord of the Rings</a
        >.<br />
        For most of his adult life, he taught English language and literature,
        specializing in Old and Middle English, at the Universities of Leeds
        (1920-25) and Oxford (1925-59). In private, Tolkien amused himself by
        writing an elaborate series of fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful,
        set in a world of his own creation. He created his own “legendarium”,
        which eventually became <em>The Silmarillion</em>, partly to provide a
        setting in which “Elvish” languages he had invented could exist. But his
        tales of Arda and Middle-earth also grew from a desire to tell stories,
        influenced by a love of myths and legends. The longest and most
        important of those stories, begun about 1930, was <em>The Hobbit</em>.
        <br />
        In 1937 <em>The Hobbit</em> was published, with pictures by the author,
        and was so popular that its publisher asked for a sequel. The result, 17
        years later, was Tolkien's masterpiece, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>,
        a modern version of the heroic epic.
