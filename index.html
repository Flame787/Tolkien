        <h2>Short biography:</h2>
        <p>
          John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein,
          South Africa and died on 2 September 1973 in Bournemouth, Hampshire,
          England. <br />He is best known as the author of the high fantasy
          classic works:
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion"
            >The Silmarillion</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_RingsThe"
            >The Lord of the Rings</a
          >.<br /><br />

          From 1911 to 1915 Tolkien was studying English Language and Literature
          in Oxford.
          <br />After finishing his degrees, Tolkien was recruted to army during
          the First World War. <br />He even participated in the famous battle
          at the Somme, but his battalion was almost completely wiped out, after
          which he returned to England. <br /><br />
          After the end of the war, Tolkien started to work at the University of
          Leeds, becoming the youngest member of the academic staff there.
          <br />1925 he took the position on Oxford as the Rawlinson and
          Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College,
          Oxford from 1925 to 1945. <br />Later on, from 1945 to 1959, he worked
          as a Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of
          Merton College, Oxford. <br /><br />
          In private, Tolkien amused himself by writing an elaborate series of
          fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful, set in a world of his own
          creation. <br />

          Inspired mostly by Old and Middle English language and literature
          (which was Tolkien's specialiation), he created his own “legendarium”,
          which eventually became <em>The Silmarillion</em>, partly to provide a
          setting in which “Elvish” languages he had invented could exist.
          <br />But his tales of Arda and Middle-earth also grew from a desire
          to tell stories, influenced by his love for myths and legends.
          <br />The longest and most important of those stories, begun about
          1930, was <em>The Hobbit</em>. <br /><br />
          <em>The Hobbit</em> was published in 1937, with illustrations made by
          Tolkien himself, and was so popular that its publisher asked for a
          sequel. <br />The result, 17 years later, was Tolkien's masterpiece,
          <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a modern version of the heroic epic,<br /> 
          which consists of three books: <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, <em>The Two Towers</em> and <em>The Return of the King</em>.
