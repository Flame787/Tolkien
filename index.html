        <h2>Short biography:</h2>
        <p>
          Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa and
          died on 2 September 1973, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England. <br />He is
          best known as the author of the high fantasy classic works:
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion"
            >The Silmarillion</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_RingsThe"
            >The Lord of the Rings</a
          >.<br /><br />

          From 1911 to 1915 Tolkien was studying English Language and Literature
          in Oxford.
          <br />
          During that time, Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a
          co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings.
          <br /><br />After finishing his degrees in English Language and
          Literature in Oxford, Tolkien was recruted to army during the First
          World War and even participated in the battle at the Somme.
          <br />Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out, following
          his return to England. <br /><br />Back in England, Tolkien was
          working as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and
          Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford from 1925 to 1945, and later as the
          Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of
          Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. <br />
          For most of his adult life, he taught English language and literature,
          specializing in Old and Middle English, at the Universities of Leeds
          and Oxford. <br /><br />In private, Tolkien amused himself by writing
          an elaborate series of fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful, set in
          a world of his own creation. <br />He created his ‚Äúlegendarium‚Äù, which
          eventually became <em>The Silmarillion</em>, partly to provide a
          setting in which ‚ÄúElvish‚Äù languages he had invented could exist.
          <br />But his tales of Arda and Middle-earth also grew from a desire
          to tell stories, influenced by his love for myths and legends.
          <br /><br />The longest and most important of those stories, begun
          about 1930, was <em>The Hobbit</em>.
          <br />
          In 1937 <em>The Hobbit</em> was published, with pictures by the
          author, and was so popular that its publisher asked for a sequel.
          <br />The result, 17 years later, was Tolkien's masterpiece,
          <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a modern version of the heroic epic.
